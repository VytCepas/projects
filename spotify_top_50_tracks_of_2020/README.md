## Installation

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. The project depends on several external packages, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Steps to Install and Run:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    `git clone <repository-url>`


2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

    It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies required by the project separate from your global Python environment:

    `python3 -m venv .venv` install virtual environment.

    `source venv/bin/activate` to activate venv for current shell.


3. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the project dependencies by running:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    For Jupyter Notebook support, also ensure Jupyter is installed: (Most probably installed with the command above)

    `pip install notebook`


4. **Run the code EDA Spotify Top 50 Tracks of 2020 Project**

    Navigate to the **EDA_Spotify_Top_50_Tracks_of_2020.ipynb** notebook file to explore and interact with done data analysis of the Spotify Top 50 Tracks of 2020 Project.
